Project Description
--------------------

Analyzing time series data of housing prices in the US over the last 24 years. All prices will be denoted in USD.


--------------------
Objective
--------------------

Our objective is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the real estate market in each of the major US cities. We will examine factors such as housing affordability, market supply and demand dynamics and property values based on their region. By studying these aspects, we aim to provide a precise perspective on the US real estate market, highlighting the unique characteristics and trends that exist within each urban center.


-----------------
Questions
-----------------
1. Which are the most expensive cities to live in the US?
2. How are the prices changing over the 24 years?
3. What is the average price in big metropolitan cities?
4. What is the relationship between the population and the property prices?
5. Where would you like to buy?

-------------------
Technologies used
-------------------

- Python: Utilized for data cleaning.
- JavaScript: Employed for backend development and data processing.
- SQL: Used to storage data.
- Flask API: Used to create an API for accessing property value data.
- HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap: Utilized for frontend development and styling.

-------------------
What did we learn?
-------------------

- We found that pretty much any end users (homeowners) and investors alike should just buy as soon as possible. Even despite the 2008 - 2009 housing crash, time will 'repair' property value so to speak. Over the past 24 years, property value has always appreciated in value over time.

- $64,000 is the lowest valued house at the moment

- $250 million is the highest price we're aware of at the moment
  
- The cities to live in would be Buffalo, Pittsburgh,  Richmond, Johnson City, Brockpon, and New Bedford.
- The higher property values are in Dallas, Houston, Washington, Chicago, New York.
- There is a linear correlation between the population and the property prices.
